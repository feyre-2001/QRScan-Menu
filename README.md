## QRScan-Menu

In this COVID period, people go to restraunts with a lot of fear. <br>
Fear of touching things with dirt and bacteria. <br>
Also, going to restraunts to order something-- phew! Looking at the menu, you may think I don't want to touch the thing that has been touched by thousands of strangers. <br>
Hence, this is a solution where you scan a QR-code and it show you the menu and thus you can order what you want.
